Password Generator! 

This project is a simple password generator. My approach to completing the task started with creating the appropriate variables & arrays to fit the requirements for the generator. You will see the application of "while" loops to force particular inputs for the user., "if" loops are present to assist in reading a block of code & accepting the input if the user would like the character in their password. "For" loops allowed for the looping of the user's input to create a password. The generator will ask you for the size of the password you'd like. You will have the option to select criteria for characters that will then be calculated & a password will be generated. The motivation for this project was my eagerness to learn & understand the concepts of JavaScript; I learned a significant amount of information along the way that will assist in better equipping me for future needs.
